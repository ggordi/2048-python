## Python implementation of 2048 using Tkinter
In this project, I used the Tkinter and Python to replicate the essential functionality and basic visuals of the
popular 2048 game. To run the game, download `final_app.py` and `styles.py` and the appropriate libraries, and run 
`final_app.py`. The game will stop once the user reaches a score of 2048 or can no longer make any moves on the board.
